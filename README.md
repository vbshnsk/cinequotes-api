# cinequotes-api
This is an API service set to work with [cinequotes-translation-worker](https://github.com/vbshnsk/cinequotes-translation-worker)!

To run it locally you will need: Node.js (>= 13) and Docker(-compose), if you need to run Google services emulators (e.g. for tests).

To set up the environment, please refer to the config.ts file, that's where you can set up Firebase and Google PubSub options.
